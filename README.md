# Ceros Ski Code Challenge - Fixed

Welcome to the fixed Ceros Code Challenge - Ski Edition!

For this challenge fix,  you can play my version here: 
https://ceros-skimaster-fixed.herokuapp.com/

Also you can find all source code and files deployed on my github account 
https://github.com/halagrantgerges/ceros-skimaster


What I've done in this build:

1. I've performed code review
2. Fixed/refactored the code.
3. Fixed the reported bug:
  The bug was
  * Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Load the game
    1. Crash into an obstacle
    1. Press the left arrow key
  * Expected Result: The skier gets up and is facing to the left
  * Actual Result: Giant blizzard occurs causing the screen to turn completely white (or maybe the game just crashes!)
  
  4.Added a new feature to the game to make it more enjoyable :
      * Implemented jumps. (click on space) 
      * Added a score.
      * Added top score
      * Added speed indicator
      * Feed the hungry Rhino. If skier skied for too long (distance: 800), a yeti would chase you
      down and eat you. 
      
  5. Update this README file with my comments about work.
  
  6. Deployed code: you can find all source code and files deployed on my github account 
https://github.com/halagrantgerges/ceros-skimaster

  7. Be original: code is developed by just me!

Bonus:
  1. Provide a way to reset the game once the game is over (click in "Esc" once the game is over)
  2. Skier should get faster as the game progresses (please check speed indicator)
  3. Deploy the game to a server: Deployed code on hero kuapp
